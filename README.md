# Python-Weather-Application
Uses API service from OpenWeatherMap and ipinfo. Displays current weather of any city and current Location


Here I used Python Library PyQt5 to Create the GUI. 
I used OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather Info.
OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/

For Finding the Location of the device, We used IPInfo API to get location from our IP Address.
IPInfo: https://ipinfo.io/

Then I made use of the gmplot Library to plot the received co-ordinates and plot it on the map. Map is provided by google API although I haven't used Google API.

Here Are Some Glimpse of Running GUI
